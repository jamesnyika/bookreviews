## Chapter 4 - Should a tweet be escalated to your support team ?
 
----

A good chapter explaining the how the NLTK library can be used.

### Highlights
* Mention of how to operationalize it
* A very approachable style of writing that leads one idea to the next. I still think the business user
  will be at a disadvantage not knowing python but at least they can take it as is and put in in AWS.

### Suggested improvements
* Some mention of what it takes to keep the model continuously enriched. How do you keep it improving and does it require retraining everything ?
