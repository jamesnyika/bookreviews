# Chapter 1 - How machine learning applies to business automation
---

  Excellent approach to addressing the challenges of business to change is superb.
  While I agree with the challenges of getting companies and groups to change I think a mention of the challenges
  of appropriate design of systems is fair game. It rounds out the claim, at the least

  ## Highlights
  * Perfect type of introduction to the topic
  * Good Table breaking apart the input, outputs etc of each. Very very useful and clarifying the structure

  ## Improvement
  * A good resource pointer to some topics for those who want to understand some of the underlying technical information may be useful. I am unsure if this chapter or an appendix is the place but the book should offer it.
