## Chapter 6 - Forecasting your companyâ€™s monthly power usage

----
#### Highlights
* A review of time series data was crucial and very well done.
* This chapter was implementation heavy and could have provided more intuition to the reader of what the neural network was doing - essentially modeling a very non-linear function. It would be useful to understand that regression methods cannot be used to estimate future usage because they might not easily model the non-linearity they way a NN can.

* I would also add a few more interim plots of some of the outputs to give the user a sense of what they are looking at.

* It might also be fruitful to remove the person weights analogy. I am not sure it necessarily helped me understand any better. The power costs as shown were sufficient.
