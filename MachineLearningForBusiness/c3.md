# Chapter 3 -  Should you call a customer because they are at risk of churning ?
-----

* Another good chapter with a practical application of ML to a real business challenge

* I think there is a missed opportunity in being able to clearly frame the business problem: The churn is the proximate and root cause for the business problem which is the drop in revenue. Dropping revenue is the undesired outcome and we will need this truly capture management's attention. Part of the business case for using ML here necessarily involves providing an estimate for how serious the impact of churn is on revenues (relative to other costs like customer acquisition cost.) I believe your excellent book can deliver more value if it quite literally provides the business case as part of the story for why ML should be used in this case.

* 3.3.1. Transformation 1: Normalize the data
Please help the reader intuitively understand the need for normalization.

* In the previous chapter we performed a dimensionality reduction to make the algorithm more explainable. Perhaps a note identifying that we have the opposite happening here with feature increase and that there is no one rule for handling dimensionality of the problem at hand. It depends.
