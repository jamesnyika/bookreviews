# Chapter 5 - Programming smart contracts in Solidity
---

## General Comments
* Understanding the mapping construct is a little difficult. The examples showing how the mappings are done were useful but a few more may help. For example :
  *  What does it mean to have a mapping to another mapping ?
  *  how deep can the nesting go ?  
  *  How do you relate the items in the mapping to the square brackets ?

 This part of the syntax is not clear

* It would help to understand when one should use require instead of the if-else conditions or other conditionals supported by Solidity. Programmers would instinctively reach for the latter yet the examples show that require is how a 'condition' for execution is built. How do you decide ?
