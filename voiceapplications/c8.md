# Chapter 8 - Managing Smart contracts with Web3.js
---

## General Comments
* Good overview of an alternative method for managing smart contracts
* I enjoyed creating the test network to work on. This may be a better way to work because it prevents the long sync times if you are connected to the test networks.  
* I would add a warning about how long the test or main networks take to connect to at the beginning of the page. My mac actually ran out of space syncing to the Ropsten network.
