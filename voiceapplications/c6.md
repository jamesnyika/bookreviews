# Chapter 6 - Writing more complex smart contracts
---

## General Comments
* A very good introduction to the business problem that we were going to solve.
* A way to understand how a contract can be treated *as a library* as opposed to the actual application *using the library* is a key concept that this chapter helped me understand.
* I noticed that the source code requires modification when put into Remix. Usually have to eliminate the comments at the bottom, remove some inline comments and also change imports. Is there a way to organize it so that once pasted one can quickly save the file with a name, add the next and be able to continue to get to the result as quickly as possible ?


## Specific Comments
* Page 3 - The contract is called Crowdsale, however the constructor on Page 4 is for a *Simple*Crowdsale. Should constructor names match the contract exactly ?  or is Crowdsale essentially an interface definition that is used for understanding purposes.
