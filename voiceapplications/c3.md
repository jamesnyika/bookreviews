---

## General Comments
* This was an excellent chapter. Very good foundation for the book and the platform.

## Specific Line Item Comments

* Page 4 -  Faucets need to be updated. The one provided was broken. I used http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/

*Page 4 - I was not able to get mining to start on my mac. For some reason, the option in my wallet would not do anything. I also found that trying to start
  mining after a geth attach did not work. Maybe a troubleshooter sentence or two may be useful. 

* Page 13 - Reference to the yellow paper "...described in the Yellow Paper"
    - There is no information on what this means. Did you mean White Paper ? or something else ? Is there a link to this resource ..
