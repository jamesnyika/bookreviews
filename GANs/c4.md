# Chapter 4 Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
---
  ## Highlights
  * Working Notebook code
  * Recap of the CNNs relative to single layer connected networks. This is actually
    a difference I was not aware of until you highlighted it.


  ## Suggestions for improvement
  
  *  Please add in the book somewhere a comparison of the different types of GANs to compare them on some
   dimensions. For example. A table that differentiates them by the types of input they typically process; how deep the layers
    normally are; fully connected or not; do they reduce dimensionality or not; typical output type etc.

  * Page 6 - reference to the minibatch could be clearer. The concept of normalization is well explained but if you could talk a little bit about how the batch is selected it would clarify further.
