# Chapter 2 Autoencoders as a Path to GANs
---

  One of the best chapters introducing the topic. I really enjoyed the way in which it describes each component of a GAN.

  ## Highlights
  * Clear summarization of what a GAN is composed of.
  * Good Table breaking apart the input, outputs etc of each. Very very useful and clarifying the structure

  ## Improvement
  * A good resource pointer to some topics for those who want to understand some of the underlying technical information may be useful. I am unsure if this chapter or an appendix is the place but the book should offer it.
