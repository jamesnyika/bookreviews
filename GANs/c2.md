# Chapter 2 Autoencoders as a Path to GANs
---

  One of the best chapters introducing the topic. I really enjoyed the way in which it describes each component of a GAN.

  ## Highlights
  * Clear summarization of what a GAN is composed of.
  * Good Table breaking apart the input, outputs etc of each. Very very useful and clarifying the structure
  * By providing a notebook we are able to make changes and explore.. a very good addition

  ## Improvement
  * A good resource pointer to some topics for those who want to understand some of the underlying technical information may be useful. I am unsure if this chapter or an appendix is the place but the book should offer it.

  * It was not clear where the Keras model comes in. It might seem trite but I think it is important to clearly delineate the steps a little better: for example:
     - The generator is basically like a de-convolution layer. It was easy to miss that if it is not called out explicitly as some thing to look out for.

     - I unfortunately got lost in the transition from the model to the handwritten letters. There are many leaps made that regardless of expertise should just be clearly drawn out to make the book more approachable.
