# Chapter 10 Adversarial Examples
---
  An interesting chapter. It was curious to see the somewhat strange 'failure modes' of networks like ResNet with pure noise. Even at low probability estimates, it was still disturbing.

  * I think this material probably needs to be treated in the context of a real world business example or security example as you alluded to in a number of places.  

  * Key comment: One way to think about GANs—indeed, as Goodfellow’s pre-GANs work suggests—is as almost automated adversarial examples
