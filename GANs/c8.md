# Chapter 8 Conditional GANs
---

  ## Highlights
  * Summary table for comparison.
  * Diagrams showing the architecture.

  ## Recommendations
  * Recommendation: 3D layered images of the actual layers of the input, hidden and output layers of the discriminator and generator to highlight the architecture would really help.

  * Similar comments to the previous chapter.
