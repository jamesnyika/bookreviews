# Chapter 5 Training & Common Challenges: GANing for Success
---

  ## Highlights
  * An important chapter to include (especially seeing my recent comments)
  * Good references to papers that might help understanding of the options
  * A good summary of the best practices

  ## General Comments
  * Not sure how much to recommend here as a lot of it was over my head in terms of the specific calculations and techniques, but I will observe the following:
     * The table at the end summarizing the findings was helpful
     * Key points - training the discriminator in advance, possibly avoiding use of batch normalization in the Generator - all well taken.


  I hope there is a way for these different techniques to be made more approachable/reachable by the lay-data scientist. It is still hard to grasp or to intuit unfortunately. Or maybe it is just my own limitations.
