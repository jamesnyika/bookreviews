# Chapter 12 Looking Ahead
---
  This is a good chapter in that it addresses the ethics question

  * It would help to describe to the reader some instances of the improper use of GANs or AI in general. Some of the terms like DeepFakes are interesting but they leave the reader hanging (what are they !!! ... tell me a little more)

  * The cutting edge references were excellent - particularly SAGAN. I was glad you included DeOldify as it is a tool I have used and happy to see that it has been considered and used.
