# Chapter 11 Practical Applications of GANs
---
  This is probably my favorite chapter.

  * "As a result, many medical applications have been unable to benefit from
the advances in deep learning and AI." - This is an excellent point that should be highlighted. The authors would do well to highlight this wherever possible as either/both:
    - a canary in the mine for domains with a proclivity for closed-ness and minimal sharing of data, techniques, hyperparameter settings etc and their opportunity to take advantage of the crowd to validate and experiment, push boundaries using AI/ML in the domain.

    - a red flag for industries where the use of GANs and DNN technology in general could be abused due to limited visibility into the training techiques used. For those concerned about the auditability and related fairness of algorithms this is as rallying point.

  * Key comment: One way to think about GANs—indeed, as Goodfellow’s pre-GANs work suggests—is as almost automated adversarial examples
