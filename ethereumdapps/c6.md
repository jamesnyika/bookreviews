# Chapter 6 - Writing more complex smart contracts
---

## General Comments
* A very good introduction to the business problem that we were going to solve.
* A way to understand how a contract can be treated *as a library* as opposed to the actual application *using the library* is a key concept that this chapter helped me understand.

## Specific Comments
* Page 3 - The contract is called Crowdsale, however the constructor on Page 4 is for a *Simple*Crowdsale. Should constructor names match the contract exactly ?  or is Crowdsale essentially an interface definition that is used for understanding purposes.
