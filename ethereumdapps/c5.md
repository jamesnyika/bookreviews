# Chapter 5 - Programming smart contracts in Solidity
---

## General Comments
* Syntax is changing rapidly on the language so there were some warnings with the code supplied.
* Ethereum Wallet has a number of new options like the Sync Light client. Consider adding a description of what that option does.

## Specific Line Item Comments

* Page 4 -  When adding my solidity code I had to use the new "emit" keyword  in the last line of code.
````
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
contract SimpleCoin {
mapping (address => uint256) public coinBalance;
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
function SimpleCoin(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    coinBalance[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;   
}
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
    require(coinBalance[msg.sender] > _amount);
    require(coinBalance[_to] + _amount >= coinBalance[_to] );
    coinBalance[msg.sender] -= _amount;  
    coinBalance[_to] += _amount;   
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);  
}
}

* Page 4 - I could not deploy my contract to the Ropsten network using the Ethereum Wallet application. The contract was consistently rejected and never confirmed by any peers. Perhaps it was my setup but there might need to be a bit of troubleshooting on what to try if contract deployment fails.

* Page 7 - Ambiguity in definition of Transaction confirmation:  ...each new block is appended to the block containing the transaction. Do you mean each new *transaction* or each new *block*. Perhaps an illustration of how confirmations happen ?
