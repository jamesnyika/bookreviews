# Chapter 4 - Deploying your first smart contract
---

## General Comments
* This was an excellent chapter. Very good foundation for the book and the platform. 
* Quick Recap of Ethereum
  - I realize that most people reading this should be familiar with Ethereum but a short 1 page recap or paragraph is critical. The items covered are the elements of
    what goes into a node, contract and other artifacts but Ethereum as a system compared to other blockchains might merit a few words.


## Specific Line Item Comments

* Page 4 -  Faucets need to be updated. The one provided was broken. I used http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/

* Page 13 - Reference to the yellow paper "...described in the Yellow Paper"
    - There is no information on what this means. Did you mean White Paper ? or something else ? Is there a link to this resource ..
