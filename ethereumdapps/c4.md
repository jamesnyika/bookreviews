# Chapter 4 - Deploying your first smart contract

## General Comments
* Syntax is changing rapidly on the language so there were some warnings with the code supplied.

## Specific Line Item Comments

* Page 4 -  When adding my solidity code I had to use the new "emit" keyword  in the last line of code.
````
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
contract SimpleCoin {
mapping (address => uint256) public coinBalance;
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
function SimpleCoin(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    coinBalance[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;   
}
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
    require(coinBalance[msg.sender] > _amount);
    require(coinBalance[_to] + _amount >= coinBalance[_to] );
    coinBalance[msg.sender] -= _amount;  
    coinBalance[_to] += _amount;   
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);  
}
}

* Page 13 - Reference to the yellow paper "...described in the Yellow Paper"
    - There is no information on what this means. Did you mean White Paper ? or something else ? Is there a link to this resource ..
