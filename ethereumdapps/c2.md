    - for the physical text, a resource reference sheet or set of links at the end might work very well.

## Specific Line Item Comments

* Page 2 - 'What if the rules ~~suspending~~  escrowing  and then releasing the money transfer where encoded in logic, not subjected to manual interaction? ...''
  - If money is not really suspended but rather it is held back till delivery then I would recommend using the word  'escrowing'. There might be a better word for this though but this is what I would think of it as.


* Page 3 - Definition of Centralized Application : A centralized application or system is controlled by a single or central entity: *an individual*, a company, an institution, a governmental agency.  
    - add individual to the list of controllers of applications

* Page 26 - The line "You can see it by clicking on the “Copy Address” button." is not clear. I looked for this button on the interface and could not find it. You might want to put an image of it.
